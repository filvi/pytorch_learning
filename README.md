# Pytorch Learning

## Repo legend
1. Pytorch basics
2. Coming soon... 

Some useful information (for me at least), about how pytorch works the code is written in Jupyter Notebook VSC compatible way so you can run the chunks of code one by one.


## Pytorch basics

Some examples to understand how basics idea of pytorch. 
Table of content:
- empty tensor
- ones tensor
- zeros tensor
- size of tensor
- from list to tensor
- random tensor
- basic operations with tensors
- in place operations with tensors
- slicing tensors
- reshape a tensor with view
- from tensor to numpy (with caveats CPU/GPU related)
- from numpy to tensor (with caveats CPU/GPU related)
- assigning tensor to GPU
